# Scenario


## title
ðŸ“Ž Basic objects controlled by the Oblectamenta-VM.



## Given
A stack



## And
statically allocated data 



## And
code (text segment) 



## And
 the stack where computations are performed



## And
 the register file



## Then
These pieces form a complete environment for running Oblectamenta machine code

### result
:heavy_check_mark: Passed







# Scenario


## title
ðŸ“Ž A VM contains code, data, stack, a compute stack and a registers file.



## Given
An empty stack

stack{}



## And
statically allocated data with no entries

data{}



## And
code (text segment) with no code

text{}



## And
 the stack where computations are performed without any data

compute_stack{}



## And
 the register file

### registers
CSP{0}

FP{0}

PC{0}

SP{4096}





## When
 A default constructed VM



## Then
 The constructed VM contains stack,data, code, and the compute stack which are all empty.

### result
:heavy_check_mark: Passed







# Scenario


## title
ðŸ“Ž The data, stack and compute stack of a VM can be initialized with data.



## Given
A stack initialized with data

stack{3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}



## And
non empty statically allocated data

data{9 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}



## And
code (text segment) with no code

text{}



## And
compute stack with data

compute_stack{81 0 0 0 16 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}



## When
 Creating a VM with initialized stack, data and compute stack



## Then
 The created VM's stack, data, and compute stack are initialized with the given data.

### result
:heavy_check_mark: Passed







# Scenario


## title
ðŸ“Ž Data entries can contain labels.



## Given
non empty statically allocated data with labels

data{l1 9 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 l2 1 0 0 0 l3 103 97 114 103 97 109 101 108}



## When
 Creating a VM with initialized data 



## Then
 The created VM's stack, data, and compute stack are initialized with the given data.

### result
:heavy_check_mark: Passed







# Scenario


## title
ðŸ“Ž The text segment contains a sequence of opcodes (machine language).
Oblectamenta's assembler translates assembler code, i.e. symbols
representing opcodes, into machine language.
Assembler code has to be placed within an asm-struct.



## Given
code (text segment) with 5 noops

### text
asm{noop noop noop noop noop}





## When
 Creating and running a VM



## Then
 The created VM's stack, data, and compute stack are initialized with the given data.

### result
:heavy_check_mark: Passed
